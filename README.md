# Tools

## Web Framework Hardening
- [Helmet](https://www.npmjs.com/package/helmet) - Helmet helps you secure your Express apps by setting various HTTP headers.
- [koa-helmet](https://www.npmjs.com/package/koa-helmet) - koa-helmet helps you secure your Koa apps by setting various HTTP headers.
- [blankie](https://github.com/nlf/blankie) - CSP plugin for [hapi](https://github.com/hapijs/hapi).

## Static Code Analysis
- [eslint-plugin-security](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-plugin-security) - ESLint rules for Node Security. This project will help identify potential security hotspots, but finds a lot of false positives which need triage by a human.
- [tslint-plugin-security](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tslint-config-security) - TSLint rules for Node Security. This project will help identify potential security hotspots, but finds a lot of false positives which need triage by a human.
- [safe-regex](https://www.npmjs.com/package/safe-regex) - detect potentially catastrophic exponential-time regular expressions by limiting the star height to 1.
- [vuln-regex-detector](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vuln-regex-detector) - This module lets you check a regex for vulnerability. In JavaScript, regular expressions (regexes) can be "vulnerable": susceptible to catastrophic backtracking. If your application is used on the client side, this can be a performance issue. On the server side, this can expose you to Regular Expression Denial of Service (REDOS).
- [git-secrets](https://github.com/awslabs/git-secrets) - Prevents you from committing secrets and credentials into git repositories.
- [DevSkim](https://github.com/Microsoft/DevSkim) - DevSkim is a set of IDE plugins and rules that provide security "linting" capabilities. Also has support for CLI so it can be integrated into CI/CD pipeline.
- [ban-sensitive-files](https://github.com/bahmutov/ban-sensitive-files) - Checks filenames to be committed against a library of filename rules to prevent storing sensitive files in Git. Checks some files for sensitive contents (for example authToken inside .npmrc file).
- [NodeJSScan](https://github.com/ajinabraham/nodejsscan) - A static security code scanner for Node.js applications. Including neat UI that can point where the issue is and how to fix it.
- [Nsecure](https://github.com/ES-Community/nsecure) - Node.js CLI that allow you to deeply analyze the dependency tree of a given npm package or a directory.
- [Trust But Verify](https://github.com/verifynpm/tbv) - TBV compares an npm package with its source repository to ensure the resulting artifact is the same.
- [lockfile-lint](https://github.com/lirantal/lockfile-lint) - lint lockfiles for improved security and trust policies to keep clean from malicious package injection and other insecure configurations.
- [pkgsign](https://github.com/RedpointGames/pkgsign) - A CLI tool for signing and verifying npm and yarn packages.
- [sast-scan](https://github.com/AppThreat/sast-scan) - Fully open-source SAST scanner supporting a range of languages and frameworks.
- [semgrep](https://semgrep.dev) - Open-source, offline, easy-to-customize static analysis for many languages. Some others on this list (NodeJSScan) use semgrep as their engine.
- [npm-scan](https://github.com/spaceraccoon/npm-scan) - An extensible, heuristic-based vulnerability scanning tool for installed npm packages.

## Input Validation & Output Encoding
- [node-esapi](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-esapi) - node-esapi is a minimal port of the ESAPI4JS (Enterprise Security API for JavaScript) encoder.

- [js-string-escape](https://www.npmjs.com/package/js-string-escape) - Escape any string to be a valid JavaScript string literal between double quotes or single quotes.
- [validator](https://github.com/chriso/validator.js) - An npm library of string validators and sanitizers.
- [xss-filters](https://www.npmjs.com/package/xss-filters) - Just sufficient output filtering to prevent XSS!

## Secure Composition
- [pug-plugin-trusted-types](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pug-plugin-trusted-types) - Pug template plugin makes it easy to securely compose HTML from untrusted inputs and provides CSP & CSRF [automagic](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pug-plugin-trusted-types#hdr-automagic).
- [safesql](https://www.npmjs.com/package/safesql) - A tagged template (<code>mysql\`...\`</code>) that understands [Postgres](https://www.npmjs.com/package/safesql#pg)'s & [MySQL](https://www.npmjs.com/package/safesql#mysql)'s query grammar to prevent [SQL injection](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/securing-node-applications/9781491982426/ch01.html#idm140399946848800).
- [sh-template-tag](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sh-template-tag) - A tagged template (<code>sh\`...\`</code>) that understands Bash syntax so prevents [shell injection](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/securing-node-applications/9781491982426/ch01.html#idm140399951358480).
