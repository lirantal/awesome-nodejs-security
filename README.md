## Static Code Analysis
- [eslint-plugin-security](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-plugin-security) - ESLint rules for Node Security. This project will help identify potential security hotspots, but finds a lot of false positives which need triage by a human.

Follow-up notes:
* A resource for malicious incidents is [BadJS](https://badjs.org/) - a repository of malicious JavaScript that has been found in websites, extensions, npm packages, and anywhere else JavaScript lives.
* [npm zoo](https://github.com/spaceraccoon/npm-zoo) is an archive keeping track of the original malicious packages source code for educational purposes.
